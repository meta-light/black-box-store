## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types and interfaces
- Avoid `any` when possible
- Use async/await instead of promises

### React/Next.js

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use 'use client' directive when needed
- Keep components focused and reusable

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add semicolons
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment complex logic

### File Naming

- Components: `PascalCase.tsx` (e.g., `AppCard.tsx`)
- Utilities: `camelCase.ts` (e.g., `docker.ts`)
- API routes: `route.ts` in appropriate folder

## Testing

   - Check Docker containers created
   - Verify status updates

3. **App Management**
