**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify firewall settings allow outbound connections
3. Try restarting the node (Stop â†’ Start)
4. Check if the network is experiencing downtime

### Performance issues
**Symptoms:** Slow response times, high CPU/memory usage

**Solutions:**
1. Verify you meet minimum hardware requirements
2. Check system resources: `htop` or `top`
3. Restart the node to clear any memory leaks
4. Consider upgrading hardware if consistently at limits

### API key issues
**Symptoms:** "Unauthorized" or "Invalid API key" errors

**Solutions:**
1. Verify your API key is correctly set
2. Check the key hasn't expired
3. Generate a new key from your dashboard
4. Ensure no extra spaces in the key

## Maintenance

docker run --rm -v YOUR_VOLUME:/data -v $(pwd):/backup alpine tar czf /backup/backup.tar.gz /data
```

### Best Practices
- Monitor your node daily
- Keep system updated: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
- Maintain at least 20% free disk space
- Restart weekly to prevent memory leaks
- Join the community Discord/Telegram for updates
